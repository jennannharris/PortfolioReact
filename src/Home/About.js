            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I am a Junior Fullstack Developer new to the field of coding.</p>
            <p> I previously worked in many customer service and mental health care roles and I have many skills from both that I have already found to be a great benefit to my coding journey.</p>
            <p> I joke with friends that I am "Random but Awesome" which is to say that I am highly creative and always looking for 'out-of-the-box' solutions.</p>
            <p>I have two dogs and I'm eager to, at some point, become involved with animal rescue and rehabilitation. My creative skills include photography, writing, painting and knitting.</p>
            <p> The outdoors is where I find peace and as such, I always have the well-being of the environment in mind in all that I do.</p>
            <p>My drive as a caregiver and empath now merges with my new found coding skills and I'll be able to help others and find "solutions to everyday challenges".</p>
